# ABOUT-ME
Hello I’m a web designer and aspiring front-end developer based in Edmonton, Alberta. I'm passionate about designing visually engaging and user-centered web experiences from initial wireframes and UI mockups to fully responsive and accessible websites.
I love bringing creative ideas to life with a strong focus on practical UI/UX principles, semantic HTML, intrinsic web design, and modern JavaScript frameworks. Whether I'm prototyping in Figma, building WordPress themes, or writing clean and scalable CSS, I enjoy the process of solving design problems and enhancing usability for real users.

💻 Front-End Development: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React

🧱 WordPress & PHP: Custom themes

🔧 Tools I Use: TailwindCSS, GitHub, Adobe Creative Cloud, MUI

🎯 Focus Areas: Intrinsic design, accessibility (WCAG), responsive grids
